# Trigger Deployment

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-26T00:02:00.000Z

This file is used to trigger a Vercel deployment.

Last deployment trigger: Commit `286c025` - Fix generic queries and clean URLs with UTM params.

## Issues Detected:

Vercel is still running OLD CODE. URLs still have `?cid=` instead of `?utm_source=...`.

This means the `/api/jobs/refresh` endpoint is NOT using the updated code from commit `734b0e4`.

## Expected behavior:

After this deployment, all URLs in the cache should have:
```
?utm_source=chatbot_ai&utm_medium=chat_widget&utm_campaign=job_search_assistant
```

Instead of:
```
?cid=fgtsamples_fgtsamples_alljobs
```
